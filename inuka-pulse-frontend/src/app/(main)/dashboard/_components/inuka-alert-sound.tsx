/**
 * InukaAlertSound
 *
 * Invisible mount-point that wires the two hooks together:
 *   useInukaAlerts  — polls for new Critical/High alerts
 *   useAlertSound      — synthesises and plays the tone
 *
 * When a new alert arrives, it plays the appropriate tone once, then clears
 * the newAlerts list so the same alert doesn't fire again on the next render.
 *
 * Renders nothing visible — the mute toggle lives in AlertSoundToggle
 * which reads mute state from localStorage independently.
 *
 * Mount this once in the dashboard layout so it runs across all pages.
